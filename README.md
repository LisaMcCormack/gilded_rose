# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

As part of Makers' week 10 tech test week, I completed the GildedRose refactoring Kata in Ruby.  This was to test my ability to read, refactor and extend legacy code.  

First I set up my repository on Github and installed a linter and line coverage indicator.  

Then I started looking at the problem.  It is a problem that requires careful reading and understanding before I could begin refactoring.  I started by reading the legacy code and writing notes when I could understand the functions of the different parts of the code.  My aim is to turn all the nested if statements into small clean methods.
