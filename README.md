# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

As part of Makers' week 10 tech test week, I completed the GildedRose refactoring Kata in Ruby.  This was to test my ability to read, refactor and extend legacy code.  

First I set up my repository on Github and installed a linter and line coverage indicator.  

Then I started looking at the problem.  It is a problem that requires careful reading and understanding before I could begin refactoring.  I started by reading the legacy code and writing notes when I could understand the functions of the different parts of the code.  My aim is to turn all the nested if statements into small clean methods.

I then started writing all possible tests the program needs to pass.  After writing one test I ran rspec to make sure the test passes.  By writing the tests I found I was able to understand the code better.

I now have 100% test coverage.  This will help me see if the tests still pass when I start refactoring the code.
